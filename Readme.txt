In this assignment i have 3 functions. In the beginning iam starting by initializing my game array from the file given and then i am calling initilize threads function in order to start the threads and give them the right piece of the array to edit.After i have a change cell state function which is checking the neighboors of each cell and finally cchange the state according to the rules. Finally i print each generation of the array.

I have used 2 2D arrays of 100x100 for the game and 1 100 array for the threads as data structures!
